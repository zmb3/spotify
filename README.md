This is a Go wrapper for working with Spotify's
[Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/).

It aims to support every task listed in the Web API Endpoint Reference,
located [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/).

By using this library you agree to Spotify's
[Developer Terms of Use](https://developer.spotify.com/developer-terms-of-use/).

## Installation

To install the library, simply

`go get github.com/zmb3/spotify`

## Authentication

Most of the Web API functionality is available without authenticating.
However, authenticated users benefit from increased rate limits.

Features that access a user's private data require authorization.
All functions requiring authorization are explicitly marked as
such in the godoc.

Spotify uses OAuth2 for authentication, which typically requires the user to login
via a web browser.  This package includes an `Authenticator` type to handle the details for you.

Start by registering your application at the following page:

https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/.

You'll get a __client ID__ and __secret key__ for your application.  An easy way to
provide this data to your application is to set the SPOTIFY_ID and SPOTIFY_SECRET
environment variables.  If you choose not to use environment variables, you can
provide this data manually.


````Go
// the redirect URL must be an exact match of a URL you've registered for your application
// scopes determine which permissions the user is prompted to authorize
auth := spotify.NewAuthenticator(redirectURL, spotify.ScopeUserReadPrivate)

// if you didn't store your ID and secret key in the specified environment variables,
// you can set them manually here
auth.SetAuthInfo(clientID, secretKey)

// get the user to this URL - how you do that is up to you
// you should specify a unique state string to identify the session
url := auth.AuthURL(state)

// the user will eventually be redirected back to your redirect URL
// typically you'll have a handler set up like the following:
func redirectHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      // use the same state string here that you used to generate the URL
      token, err := auth.Token(state, r)
      if err != nil {
            http.Error(w, "Couldn't get token", http.StatusNotFound)
            return
      }
      // create a client using the specified token
      client := auth.NewClient(token)

      // the client can now be used to make authenticated requests
}
````

## Helpful Hints

### Default Client

For API calls that require authorization, you should create your own
`spotify.Client` using an `Authenticator`.  For calls that don't require authorization,
package level wrapper functions are provided (see `spotify.Search` for example)

These functions just proxy through `spotify.DefaultClient`, similar to the way
the `net/http` package works.

### Optional Parameters

Many of the functions in this package come in two forms - a simple version that
omits optional parameters and uses reasonable defaults, and a more sophisticated
version that accepts additional parameters.  The latter is suffixed with `Opt`
to indicate that it accepts some optional parameters.

### Automatic Retries

The API will throttle your requests if you are sending them too rapidly. This client can automatically wait and reattempt the request, but this does not happen automatically. To enable this, set the `AutoRetry` field on the `Client` struct to `true`.

## API Examples

Examples of the API can be found in the [examples](examples) directory.
